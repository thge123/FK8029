\section*{Some title}
The time independent SchrÃ¶dinger equation for the harmonic oscillator is 
\begin{equation}
    -\frac{\hbar}{2m}\frac{\text{d}^2u}{\text{d}x^2} + \frac{m\omega^2}{2}x^2 = Eu
\end{equation}
By changing the variables with $\xi = x/\sqrt{\hbar/m\omega}$ and $E' = \hbar\omega$, it can be written as 
\begin{equation}
    \label{29mar1748}
    -\frac{\text{d}^2u}{\text{d}\xi^2} + \xi^2u = 2E'u
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Numerical solution to eigenvalue problem}
We wish to solve \eqref{29mar1748} numerically by discretizing the real line and the second derivative of $u$. In order to do so, we introduce the gridpoints $\xi_j$ and the approximation of the function $u$ at these gridpoints, $u_j\approx u(\xi_j)$. Furthermore, we assume that $\xi_j\in[-L,L]$, where $L$ is chosen such that $u(\xi)\approx 0$ for $|\xi|>L$. Since the eigenfunctions of an even potential can be taken to be even or odd, we can focus on the interval $[0,L]$ and apply the boundary conditions 
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        &u'(0) = 0 \quad\text{and}\quad u(L) = 0 \quad \text{for even } u, \\ 
        &u(0) = 0 \quad\text{and}\quad u(L) = 0 \quad \text{for odd } u.
    \end{split}
\end{equation} 
The second derivative is approximated up to fourth order:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        u''(x_j) &\approx \frac{1}{12h^2}\big(-u_{j-2}+16u_{j-1}-30u_j \\ 
        &\hspace{1.7cm}+16u_{j+1}-u_{j+2}\big) 
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
Special care had to be taken at the boundaries. For the even case, two ghost points, $\xi_{-1}$ and $\xi_{-2}$, were introduced to the left of zero and two fourth order approximations of the first derivative used to  (... words ...) :

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        &u'(0) \approx \frac{1}{12h}\left(u_{-2}-8u_{-1}+8u_1-u_2\right) \\ 
        &u'(0) \approx \frac{1}{12h}\left(-3u_{-1}-10u_0+18u_1-6u_2+u_3\right)
    \end{split}
\end{equation}



\end{large}
